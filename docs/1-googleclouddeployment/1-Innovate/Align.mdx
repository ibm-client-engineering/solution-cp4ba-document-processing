## Vision

Deployment of CP4BA with Automated Document Processing upon OpenShift in Google Cloud.

### Purpose

Provide a Proof of Concept asset that is documented and deployed.

### Objectives

### Current Assumptions

- Deployment upon a smaller sized cluster but not a starter pack.
  - Update sizing to reflect smaller deployment
- GPUs to be included within the worker nodes
- Can this be done without requiring ODF and leveraging Google Cloud Filestore
  - Determine appropriate sizing requirements for storage
- Determine time required to lay down openshift and cp4ba
