### Prepare the Input File

The ADP Connect script requires a text file (.txt) as input, which allows RPA to read the required parameters to run the script. 

Each of the first 6 lines of the input file are read by RPA:
1. Folder Location (The files to send to ADP)
2. Output Location (The files sent back from ADP with the document processing results)
3. ADP URL (The URL of the ADP instance)
4. ADP Username
5. ADP Password
6. ADP Project ID (The project ID of the ADP document processing project)


Create a text file with the above information

Example:
input.txt
```
C:\Users\Joe\Documents\RPA\ADP Call\Input
C:\Users\Joe\Documents\RPA\ADP Call\Processed Files
https://cpd-adp.cp4ba-prod-na-01-blabla.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud

:::danger
All files and subfolder files in the input directory folder will be sent to ADP. You must make a new folder or use an existing folder that only contains the documents you want sent to ADP.
